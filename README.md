# GettingAndCleaningDataCourseProject
## Tidy data set is generated using the code in "run_analysis.R" file.
### First the files are loaded into R (including "activity_labels.txt", "features.txt", training and the test set files)
### Generate and label training and test set with descriptive variable names (4th in the list).
### Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
### Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
### Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
### Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  Make a subset for each subject (there are 30subjects in total).
  Take the average of each variable for each activity.
  Store it in the new dataset.
## Generated tidy data set is stored in "tidyDataSet.txt" file.
## "CodeBook.md" file describes the variables, the data, and the transformations performed to clean up the data.
